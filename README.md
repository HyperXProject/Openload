# OpenLoad Downloader
## PHP Script to download/stream video directly by OpenLoad.co
## !! This script is only for educational purposes. !!

### Description
Not contend OpenLoad.co of APIs that, for downloading of their videos, demanded not only the API Key, but must also have a captcha recognition, I endeavored to find a way to download the files from the service (bypassing the captcha).

So I achieved my goal, but fifty percent as the script allows you to download all the videos via the ID, but I could not find, however, a working way to make streaming video by adding the ability to jump parts the movie you are watching.

The script uses the "composer.json" and should be used on a service that supports it such as Heroku (where I myself have tried).

This is my "final" script, if someone succeeds where I failed, I would like to know the solution.

Good coding. ;-)
